				<h1>Depeche Mode</h1>
				<h2>In your and my room</h2>
				<p> In your room
					Where time stands still
					Or moves at your will
					Will you let the morning come soon
					Or will you leave me lying here
					In your favourite darkness
					Your favourite half-light
					Your favourite consciousness
					Your favourite slave
				</p>
				<p> In your room
					Where souls disappear
					Only you exist here
					Will you lead me to your armchair
					Or leave me lying here
					Your favourite innocence
					Your favourite prize
					Your favourite smile
					Your favourite slave
				</p>
				<p> I'm hanging on your words
					living on your breath
					feeling with your skin
					Will I always be here
					In your room
					Your burning eyes
					Cause flames to arise
					Will you let the fire die down soon
					Or will I always be here
					Your favourite passion
					Your favourite game
					Your favourite mirror
					Your favourite slave
					I'm hanging on your words
					living on your breath
					feeling with your skin
					Will I always be here
				</p>
				<p>It was beautiful song</p>
